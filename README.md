- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sumitra87
- 👀 I’m interested in Biomimicry, Sustainability, Collaboration, Architecture, and Systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how all about Race, Class, Gender and Health.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that finds a use for things that would otherwise end up in the dump. I am also interested in Micro Energy sytems to supplement or back up the grid when it fails.
- 📫 How to reach me @Sumitra87 or via Email C.sumitra.bee@gmail.com
